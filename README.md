# Modern-Cpp-CS106L

I have been using C++ for a long time, since my ungdergraduate days. However, these days, my friends and I have been discussing about the modern C++ features and how they can be used to write better code. So, I decided to take a look at some open source projects and see how they are using modern C++ features. I will try to learn these features and finish the assignments before my phd program starts.

I will focus on CS106L course from Stanford University, and this repository will follow roadmap which is provided by [HalfDreamer_ZJU](https://github.com/half-dreamer/AP1400-2).

## 1. Introductory C Programming Specialization

A course from Duke University that will help you to learn C programming from scratch. Details can be found [here](/CProgramming/CProgramming.md).
